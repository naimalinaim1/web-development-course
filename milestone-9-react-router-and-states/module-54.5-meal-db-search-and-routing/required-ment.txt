1. Select a CSS framework. With which you will practice today. Bootstrap can be reaction or tailwind. That's good to start with. The reason is today's practice. Do well today. myself -> ok

2. Try and see. You can make your website responsive by yourself.
3. Simple installs a few routes. Go to app.js. The restaurant implements a route. -> ok
4. Implement not found or 404 page.
5. Main URL or "/" implement this route.
6. Create a header component. Give some link there. Clicking on them will take you to different routes. You will see that if you click on the link, the page will not reload.
7. Add two event handlers to each card on the restaurant page. Two types. First with just link. With the button in another link. If you click on these two, it will create a dynamic url according to the ID of that menu. And on clicking that he will go to that url. Although the component to go that route has not been made yet. Do this too.
8. This time again go to app.js and declare a route with route parameter. Declare the route with a route parameter named mealdb there.
9. Declare a component to use the route parameter. Then go to that route and call the api of mealdb with the route parameter dynamically and show that data on the website.
10. Last of all. Add a button to each card. Clicking on that uses the useNavigate hook. Go to another route.
